# Personal Website! :clap:
This was my first experience with coding a website, and it turned out to be a really fun project.

**You can click [here](https://selinhekimgil.github.io/) to see.** 

I had not been exposed to HTML/CSS/JavaScript before, but the best way to learn something is to dive right into it, isn't it?
This was also my first time actually using GitHub, which should become pretty evident if you take a look at my commit history.

##### This site was, of course, built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
